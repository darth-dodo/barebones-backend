# barebones-backend
## Requirements
* Runs locally on port 8000 and accepts `GET` requests at the index URL `/`
* It checks that the request has a query parameter called `favoriteTree` with a valid value
* For a successful request, returns a properly encoded HTML document with the following content:

If `favoriteTree` was specified (e.g. a call like `127.0.0.1:8000/?favoriteTree=baobab`):

```
It's nice to know that your favorite tree is a <value of "favoriteTree" from the url> 
```

if not specified (e.g. a call like `127.0.0.1:8000/`):

```
Please tell me your favorite tree
```
